In this python notebook, we will reproduce the image above. It's a colorized composite of data from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey available from NASA here: https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/rosat/gallery/misc_allsky1.html. The ROSAT was launched 30 years ago on the day of this writing. Its observations were completed in 1990-1991 and were composited at a low resolution. The [high resolution TIF format version](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/rosat/slide_gifs/misc_rass.tif) is only 1633x815 pixels.

The image we're trying to replicate was published in _[M.J.Freyberg, R.Egger (1999), "ROSAT PSPC All-Sky Survey maps completed", in Proceedings of the Symposium "Highlights in X-ray Astronomy in honour of Joachim Tr√ºmper's 65th birthday", eds.
